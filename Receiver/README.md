# Custom Receiver Application - Player.html and Intro
As explained in the main folder README, the idea of the custom receiver is to allow easy ways to edit, store information and display other kind of content such as DRM-based ones. The chromecast device loads a simple html file (that must be simple, otherwise it would cause efficiency problems). This html file uses Javascript and CSS to provide the media structure and style, using the cast API.
