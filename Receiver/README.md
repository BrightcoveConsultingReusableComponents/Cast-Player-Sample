# Custom Receiver Application - Player.html and Intro
As explained in the main folder README, the idea of the custom receiver is to allow easy ways to edit, store information and display other kind of content such as DRM-based ones. The chromecast device loads a simple html file (that must be simple, otherwise it would cause efficiency problems). This html file uses Javascript and CSS to provide the media structure and style, using the cast API.
# Structure

-player.html<br>
-css<br>
----- player.css<br>
----- assets/<br>
-js<br>
----- player.js<br>
----- styles.js

Player.html is the html loaded. Player.js coordinates the use of the API. Player.css coordinates the styling, and styles.js makes it easy to change the css if necessary without the need to go to the actual player.js code. Assets folder contains the images loaded.
